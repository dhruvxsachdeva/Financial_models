# Financial Models

This repository contains implementations of financial models that I come across while studying quantitative finance.
Each model is implemented in Python.

## Current Models

* **Binomial Option Pricing Model** – Implements the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial tree for European call and put options.
